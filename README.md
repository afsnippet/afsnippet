# AfSnippet

[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fafsnippet%2Fafsnippet.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fafsnippet%2Fafsnippet?ref=badge_shield)

The project focus is on an educational code-snippet publishing website. It has been proposed that the site allows for 3 levels of complexity for each snippet. The rest is up to you guys. Think about quality control, peer review, how you'll keep the snippets relevant only to compatible versions of tools used, etc...

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.0.
